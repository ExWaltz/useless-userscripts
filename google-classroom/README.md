# Google Classroom Complete Name

This script will add a scroll bar to long class names, school names, and assignment names.

## Key features
* Makes long text scrollable

### Why?

Because I want to see the full text of class name or activity, but google decided to hide it. Also, can teachers stop making class names and activities 999999999 letters long? thx.
